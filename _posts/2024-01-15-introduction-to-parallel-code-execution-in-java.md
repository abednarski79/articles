# Introduction to Parallel Code Execution in Java: Techniques and Examples

Parallel code execution is essential for modern applications to maximize performance by utilizing multi-core processors effectively. In Java, multiple techniques enable parallelism, from low-level thread management to high-level abstractions like parallel streams and executors. This article introduces key methods to achieve parallel execution: **Thread**, **Runnable**, **parallel streams**, and **Spring’s TaskExecutor**.

---

## 1. Using `Thread`

The `Thread` class is the most basic way to implement parallel execution. You define a task by subclassing `Thread` and overriding its `run()` method.

### Example
```java
public class MyThread extends Thread {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread thread1 = new MyThread();
        MyThread thread2 = new MyThread();
        
        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
    }
}
```

#### Pros:
- Direct and simple for small tasks.
  
#### Cons:
- Requires explicit thread management.
- Not reusable; each task needs a new thread instance.

---

## 2. Using `Runnable`

`Runnable` provides a more flexible way to define tasks. It separates the task from the thread that executes it, allowing reuse with different thread types or pools.

### Example
```java
public class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Runnable task is running: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        
        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
    }
}
```

#### Pros:
- Decouples task logic from threading.
- Enables task reuse with executors or other frameworks.

#### Cons:
- Manual thread creation and management can still lead to inefficiencies.

---

## 3. Using Parallel Streams

Java 8 introduced parallel streams, which simplify parallelism by abstracting thread management. Parallel streams use the **Fork/Join Framework** internally.

### Example
```java
import java.util.stream.IntStream;

public class ParallelStreamExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        IntStream.range(1, 10)
                 .parallel()
                 .forEach(num -> System.out.println("Processing " + num + " by " + Thread.currentThread().getName()));
    }
}
```

#### Pros:
- High-level abstraction.
- Optimized for data processing tasks.

#### Cons:
- May lead to non-deterministic behavior if state is shared.
- Performance depends on the data size and CPU cores.

## 4. Using `ExecutorService`

The `ExecutorService` provides a high-level API for managing thread pools. It decouples task submission from task execution and manages thread reuse efficiently.

### Example: Fixed Thread Pool
```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class ExecutorServiceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            int taskId = i;
            executor.submit(() -> {
                System.out.println("Executing Task " + taskId + " by " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
            });
        }

        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```

#### Pros:
- Efficient thread reuse with minimal overhead.
- Flexible with various built-in thread pool types.

#### Cons:
- Requires proper management (e.g., shutting down executors).

## 5. Using Spring’s `TaskExecutor`

Spring’s `TaskExecutor` is a high-level abstraction over Java's `Executor` framework. It integrates seamlessly with Spring applications, allowing easier configuration and dependency injection.

### Example: Configuring a Thread Pool Executor
#### Configuration
```java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.core.task.TaskExecutor;
import org.springframework.scheduling.concurrent.ThreadPoolTaskExecutor;

@Configuration
public class TaskExecutorConfig {

    @Bean
    public TaskExecutor taskExecutor() {
        ThreadPoolTaskExecutor executor = new ThreadPoolTaskExecutor();
        executor.setCorePoolSize(3);
        executor.setMaxPoolSize(5);
        executor.setQueueCapacity(10);
        executor.setThreadNamePrefix("SpringExecutor-");
        executor.initialize();
        return executor;
    }
}
```

#### Usage
```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.core.task.TaskExecutor;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class TaskExecutorExample {

    @Autowired
    private TaskExecutor taskExecutor;

    public void executeTasks() {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            int taskId = i;
            taskExecutor.execute(() -> {
                System.out.println("Executing Task " + taskId + " by " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
            });
        }
    }
}
```

#### Pros:
- Built-in integration with Spring’s lifecycle management.
- Easy configuration and monitoring.
  
#### Cons:
- Requires a Spring context.

## Best Practices for Parallel Execution
1. **Avoid shared mutable state**: Use thread-safe structures like `ConcurrentHashMap` or synchronization mechanisms if needed.
2. **Choose the right abstraction**: Use parallel streams for data-centric tasks, executors for task-based parallelism, and Spring `TaskExecutor` for Spring-managed applications.
3. **Monitor performance**: Profile your application to ensure that parallelism improves efficiency rather than increasing contention or overhead.
4. **Handle exceptions**: Properly catch and log exceptions in parallel tasks, as they might get lost otherwise.

## Conclusion

Java offers a rich ecosystem for parallel code execution, from low-level constructs like `Thread` and `Runnable` to high-level abstractions like `ExecutorService`, parallel streams, and Spring’s `TaskExecutor`. Choosing the right approach depends on your use case, task complexity, and the desired level of abstraction. Start with higher-level abstractions like `ExecutorService` or `TaskExecutor` whenever possible, as they simplify management and enhance scalability.
